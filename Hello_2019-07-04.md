# Open collector
![circuit](Hello\300px-OpencollectorV3.png)

behaves like a switch that is either connected to ground or disconnected



# Zero-ohm link
* typically 10–50 mΩ
* For trace requiring large trace current, better use a 0.001-0.003-ohm resistor, rather than the generic "zero-ohm" resistor in which the actual resistance may be higher, and tolerance is not given      

* Usage:
    * Jumper
    * Selective connections

            ![0 ohm](Hello\06-22332_zero_ohm.PNG)
            * 0 ohm between USB port and CY7C68013A USB Peripheral Controller
            * not a jumper
                * either use 0 ohm resistor / the U6 choke, actually U6 is absent in the real product
    * Current sensing before production
        * [StackExchange](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/42756/what-is-the-usage-of-zero-ohm-miliohm-resistor)
        * provide a current measurement point. During development and testing you can place a low resistance shunt resistor to measure the current, and for production replace it with a zero ohm jumper. Then you don't have to cut traces to insert the shunt resistor in the circuit. Probably less applicable, since you should have measured the current before creating the final PCB, but for very low current circuits the layout and PCB material may matter, and then you do want to measure on the final board.


# Shunt
[StackExchange](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/42756/what-is-the-usage-of-zero-ohm-miliohm-resistor)
* Bypassing the sense resistor with a capacitor - maybe 10 uF or 100 uF depending on circuit
    * further reduce impact on the circuit
* Use an eg 0.1 Ohm shunt,  
    feed the voltage via a series 1k resistor to the meter, and  
    a say 10 uF across the meter terminals.
    * reduce affected by high frequency noise



# Common-mode choke
* passing differential-mode (DM, equal but opposite) currents, while blocking common-mode (CM) currents
    * The magnetic flux produced by DM currents in the core tend to cancel each other due to negative coupled windings
    * little inductance or impedance to DM currents -> cone won't saturate -> maximum current rating is determined by the heating effect of the winding resistance only
    * Opposingly, CM currents see a high impedance

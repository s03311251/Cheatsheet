# Mech

* rivet 拉釘 == 鉚釘

* Tap & die 絲攻和絲板
  * create screw threading inside/outside a hole
  * + 翻邊攻絲 -> longer screw threading

* 圓頭螺絲 -(firmer)-> 平頭螺絲

* 沉孔 counter sink

* 倒角 chamfer

* Material
  * plating
    * due to diff. material added, Zinc plating, can in black, colorful(?), blue...
      * e.g. black one has higher corrosion resistance
      * black zinc is poorly conductive, colorful(?) one is conductive
    * Zinc whisker
      * mechanism unknown, but encouraged by stress (e.g. from electroplating)

  * painting
    * electrical-conductive painting, red in colour

  * stainless for cleanroom

## Linkage

* [Overconstrained mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overconstrained_mechanism)
  * a linkage that has more degrees of freedom than is predicted by the mobility formula
  * e.g. a hinged door, all its hinges are constraining the same degrees of freedom
  * pros: redundant, spread stress...
  * cons: tolerance of parts may need to be tighten

## Design for manufacture (DFM)

* CNC
  * Milling Tool Diameter to Length ration
    * A5M Linus Lam: "Generally the ration would be 1:10, i.e. 1mm diameter tool with 10mm cutting length. In most of the cases, the ratio would not be higher than 1:15."
